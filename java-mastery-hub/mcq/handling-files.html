                options: ["It can read binary files", "It reads data in chunks (buffered), making it faster", "It automatically closes the file", "It can write to files"],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "BufferedReader reads data in chunks (buffer) instead of one character at a time, which significantly improves performance for large files."

                answerIndex: 2,

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "try-with-resources automatically closes resources (like file streams) when the block exits, even if an exception occurs. This prevents resource leaks."

                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "A class must implement AutoCloseable (or its subinterface Closeable) to be used in try-with-resources. The close() method is called automatically."

                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "NIO stands for New Input/Output. It was introduced in Java 7 as a modern alternative to the traditional java.io package, providing better performance and more features."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Files.readAllLines() loads the entire file into memory, which can cause OutOfMemoryError for very large files (GB+). Use BufferedReader for huge files."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "mkdir() creates a single directory and fails if parent doesn't exist. mkdirs() creates the directory and all necessary parent directories."
