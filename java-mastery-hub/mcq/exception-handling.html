                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Yes, you can have multiple catch blocks to handle different exception types differently. They must be ordered from specific to general."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Exception propagation is when an uncaught exception moves up the call stack from the method where it occurred to the calling method, and so on."

                answerIndex: 3,
                explanation: "'ensure' is not a Java keyword. The valid exception handling keywords are try, catch, finally, throw, and throws."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Finally block is almost always executed, but it can be skipped if System.exit() is called or if the JVM crashes."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The finally block's return (2) overrides the try block's return (1). This is bad practice as it can suppress exceptions."

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Java 7 introduced multi-catch, allowing you to catch multiple exception types in one catch block using the pipe (|) operator."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The throws clause declares that a method might throw certain checked exceptions, informing callers that they must handle these exceptions."

                options: ["Catching Exception", "Catching specific types", "Both are equally good", "Neither should be caught"],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Catching specific exception types is better because it allows different handling for different errors and makes debugging easier."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared with throws. Not doing so results in a compilation error."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Yes, you can rethrow an exception using the throw keyword inside a catch block. This is useful for logging before propagating."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Try-with-resources automatically closes resources (that implement AutoCloseable) when the try block exits, even if an exception occurs."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "No, exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions, not normal flow control. They have performance overhead and reduce code clarity."

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Exception chaining is wrapping one exception inside another to preserve the original cause. This is done by passing the original exception to the new exception's constructor."
