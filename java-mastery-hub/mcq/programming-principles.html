                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 2,

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "High coupling is bad - it means classes are tightly dependent on each other. Changes in one class can break others. We want low coupling (loose dependencies)."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "High cohesion is good - it means a class is focused on a single, well-defined purpose. All methods work toward the same goal."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "A 'God class' is an anti-pattern where a class does too many things, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. It becomes a maintenance nightmare."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "It means depending on abstractions (interfaces/abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations. This makes code flexible and testable."

                answerIndex: 3,
                explanation: "Dependency Injection is a technique that implements the Dependency Inversion Principle by injecting dependencies rather than creating them internally."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Use Singleton when you need exactly one instance of a class (like configuration, logger, connection pool). Don't overuse it - it can make testing difficult."

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "MVC provides separation of concerns, enables parallel development, and improves testability. It doesn't necessarily make code execute faster."

                answerIndex: 1,
